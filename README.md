## 📘 Project Overview

**CinePark** is a web-based cinema platform designed to offer a **personalized and engaging movie discovery experience**. The application integrates core features of modern web development—such as **user authentication**, **profile management**, and **AI-powered recommendations**, while staying faithful to a visually consistent **Figma-based design**.

### The interface includes:
- Homepage  
- Login and sign-up screens  
- Personality-based questionnaire  
- User profile view  
- Options to log out or retake the questionnaire  

> Our goal was to make the platform not only functional, but also **visually attractive and user-friendly**.

## 🔑 Main Features

### ✅ User Authentication
A fully functional sign-up and login system that stores user data in a lightweight `.csv` file, making it easy to manage during development.

### ✅ Preference-Based Questionnaire
After signing up or logging in, users complete a questionnaire combining **personality questions and film ratings**. This data drives the recommendation system.

### ✅ User Profiles
Users can view their personal information and **retake the questionnaire** anytime to update their preferences and receive new recommendations.

### ✅ AI-Powered Recommendation Engine
The app uses questionnaire responses to generate **personalized film suggestions**. It also provides a short explanation of *why* each movie is recommended, increasing **transparency and user engagement**.

## 🧾 Final Remarks

**CinePark** reflects a balanced combination of **user-centered design**, **AI-enhanced personalization**, and **hands-on technical implementation**. We invested significant effort in making the interface **clean, appealing, and intuitive**, believing that this is essential to create a product that is both **catchy and easy to navigate**.

To explain how our recommendation system works, we’ve included the following document:
